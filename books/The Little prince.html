    </div>
    <div class="story">Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in
        a book, called <i>True Stories from Nature</i>, about the primeval forest. It
        was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a
        copy of the drawing.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/1a.gif" height="183"
                                          width="301" alt="Boa"></div>
    <div class="story">In the book it said: <em>"Boa constrictors swallow their
        prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they
        sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</em></div>
    <div class="story">I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.
        And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.
        My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/sombrero.gif" height="80"
                                          width="241" alt="Hat"></div>
    <div class="story">I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them
        whether the drawing frightened them.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But they answered: <em>"Frighten? Why should any one be
        frightened by a hat?"</em></div>
    <div class="story">My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a
        boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to
        understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor,
        so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things
        explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/boa.gif" height="92"
                                          width="242" alt="Elephant inside the boa"></div>
    <div class="story">The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay
        aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside,
        and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That
        is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career
        as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One
        and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves,
        and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to
        them.
    </div>
    <div class="story">So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot
        airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true
        that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China
        from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
    </div>
    <div class="story">In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters
        with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I
        have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at
        hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted,
        I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always
        kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding.
        But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
    </div>

    <div class="story"><em>"That is a hat."</em></div>
    <div class="story">Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors,
        or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would
        talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up
        would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" width="100" height="117" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/chapter2.gif" alt="II">
    </div>
    <div class="story">So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really
        talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six
        years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a
        mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all
        alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking
        water to last a week.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a
        thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked
        sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement,
        at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What!"</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Draw me a sheep!"</em></div>
    <div class="story">I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my
        eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary
        small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may
        see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is
        certainly very much less charming than its model.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/retrato.gif" height="250"
                                          width="224" alt="The Little prince"></div>
    <div class="story">That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me
        in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw
        anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly
        starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a
        thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither
        to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or
        hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost
        in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at
        last I was able to speak, I said to him:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But--what are you doing here?"</em></div>
    <div class="story">And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were
        speaking of a matter of great consequence:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"If you please--draw me a sheep . . ."</em></div>
    <div class="story">When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.
        Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in
        danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.
        But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history,
        arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that
        I did not know how to draw. He answered me:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep . . ."</em></div>
    <div class="story">But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the
        two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the
        outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:
    </div>

    <div class="story"><em>"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa
        constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is
        very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep.
        Draw me a sheep."</em></div>
    <div class="story">So then I made a drawing.</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/2b.gif" height="113"
                                          width="128" alt="Sick sheep"></div>
    <div class="story">He looked at it carefully, then he said:</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</em></div>
    <div class="story">So I made another drawing.</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/2c.gif" height="119"
                                          width="126" alt="A ram"></div>
    <div class="story">My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You see yourself,"</em> he said, <em>"that this is not
        a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."</em></div>

    <div class="story">So then I did my drawing over once more.</div>
    <div class="story">But it was rejected too, just like the others.</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</em></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/2d.gif" height="98"
                                          width="113" alt="Old sheep"></div>
    <div class="story">By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a
        hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/2e.gif" height="103"
                                          width="200" alt="Sheep in the box"></div>
    <div class="story">And I threw out an explanation with it.</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</em></div>
    <div class="story">I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my
        young judge:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that
        this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"</em></div>

    <div class="story"><em>"Why?"</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Because where I live everything is very small . . ."</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said.
        "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."</em></div>
    <div class="story">He bent his head over the drawing.</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep . . ."</em></div>
    <div class="story">And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" width="100" height="117" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/chapter3.gif" alt="III">
    </div>
    <div class="story">It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The
        little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I
        asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little,
        everything was revealed to me.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not
        draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/3a.gif" height="440"
                                          width="400" alt="The Little prince"></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What is that object?"</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It
        is my airplane."</em></div>
    <div class="story">And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</div>
    <div class="story">He cried out, then:</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What! You dropped down from the sky?"</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes,"</em> I answered, modestly.</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh! That is funny!"</em></div>

    <div class="story">And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter,
        which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Then he added:</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</em></div>
    <div class="story">At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable
        mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Do you come from another planet?"</em></div>
    <div class="story">But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without
        taking his eyes from my plane:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is true that on that you can't have come from very
        far away . . ."</em></div>
    <div class="story">And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then,
        taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his
        treasure.
    </div>
    <div class="story">You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence
        about the <em>"other planets."</em> I made a great effort, therefore, to find
        out more on this subject.
    </div>

    <div class="story"><em>"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where
        I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"</em></div>
    <div class="story">After a reflective silence he answered:</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The thing that is so good about the box you have given
        me is that at night he can use it as his house."</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a
        string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."</em></div>
    <div class="story">But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/estrellas.gif" height="290"
                                          width="212" alt="The Little prince and stars"></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Tie him! What a queer idea!"</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will
        wander off somewhere, and get lost."</em></div>
    <div class="story">My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</div>

    <div class="story"><em>"But where do you think he would go?"</em></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."</em></div>
    <div class="story">Then the little prince said, earnestly:</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so
        small!"</em></div>
    <div class="story">And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far . . ."</em></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" width="100" height="117" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/chapter4.gif" alt="IV">
    </div>
    <div class="story">I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this
        was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a
        house!
    </div>
    <div class="story">But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well
        that in addition to the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to
        which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are
        so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an
        astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number.
        He might call it, for example, <em>"Asteroid 325"</em>.

    </div>
    <div class="story">I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which
        the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.
    </div>
    <div class="story">This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope.
        That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/4b.gif" height="274"
                                          width="248" alt="Star-gazer"></div>
    <div class="story">On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to
        the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in
        Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Grown-ups are like that . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story">Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a
        Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should
        change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all
        over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody
        accepted his report.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/4c.gif" height="188"
                                          width="247" alt="Turkish astronomer"></div>
    <div class="story">If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made
        a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways.
        When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any
        questions about essential matters. They never say to you, <em>"What does his
            voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?"</em>
        Instead, they demand: <em>"How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much
            does he weigh? How much money does his father make?"</em> Only from these
        figures do they think they have learned anything about him.
    </div>
    <div class="story">If you were to say to the grown-ups: <em>"I saw a beautiful
        house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,"</em>

        they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to
        say to them: <em>"I saw a house that cost $20,000."</em> Then they would
        exclaim: <em>"Oh, what a pretty house that is!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Just so, you might say to them: <em>"The proof that the
        little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was
        looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists."</em>
        And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders,
        and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: <em>"The planet he came
            from is Asteroid B-612,"</em> then they would be convinced, and leave you in
        peace from their questions.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/4d.gif" height="187"
                                          width="270" alt="European astronomer"></div>
    <div class="story">They are like that. One must not hold it against them.
        Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a
        matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion
        of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: <em>"Once upon a time there was
            a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself,
            and who had need of a sheep . . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">To those who understand life, that would have given a much
        greater air of truth to my story.

    <div class="story">For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have
        suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already
        passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe
        him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is
        sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the
        grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story">It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of
        paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I
        have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the
        outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall
        certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at
        all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no
        resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's
        height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some
        doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good,
        now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.
    </div>
    <div class="story">In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also.
        But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained
        anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do
        not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like
        the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.

    </div>
    <div class="story">As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something
        about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The
        information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts.
        It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the
        baobabs.
    </div>
    <div class="story">This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For
        the little prince asked me abruptly--as if seized by a grave doubt--<em>"It is
            true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, that is true."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah! I am glad!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I did not understand why it was so important that sheep
        should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not
        little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if
        he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one
        single baobab.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince
        laugh.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"We would have to put them one on top of the other,"</em>
        he said.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/5a.gif" height="235"
                                          width="231" alt="Elephans on the planet"></div>
    <div class="story">But he made a wise comment:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being
        little."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why
        do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He answered me at once, <em>"Oh, come, come!"</em>, as if he
        were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a
        great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the
        little prince lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In
        consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad
        plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's
        darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then
        this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a
        charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a
        sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it
        might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible,
        the very first instant that one recognizes it.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/5b.gif" height="250"
                                          width="305" alt="Chare of the planet"></div>
    <div class="story">Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the
        home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of
        that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never
        be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire
        planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small,
        and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is a question of discipline,"</em> the little prince
        said to me later on. <em>"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning,
            then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the
            greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at
            the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which
            they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,"</em>
        the little prince added, <em>"but very easy."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And one day he said to me: <em>"You ought to make a
        beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all
        this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.
        Sometimes,"</em> he added, <em>"there is no harm in putting off a piece of work
        until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a
        catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected
        three little bushes . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a
        drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But
        the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks
        would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am
        breaking through my reserve. <em>"Children," I say plainly, "watch
            out for the baobabs!"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a
        long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so
        hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all
        the trouble it has cost me.
    </div>
    <img class="center" alt="Baobabs" height="377" width="300" rel="lightbox"
         src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/baobaby.gif">
    <div class="story">Perhaps you will ask me, <em>"Why are there no other drawing
        in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have
        not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond
        myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.

    </div>
    <div class="story">Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the
        secrets of your sad little life . . . For a long time you had found your only
        entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new
        detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a
        sunset now."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But we must wait,"</em> I said.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Wait? For what?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"For the sunset. We must wait until it is time."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you
        laughed to yourself. You said to me:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am always thinking that I am at home!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United
        States the sun is setting over France.
    </div>
    <div class="story">If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go
        straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away
        for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move
        your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling
        whenever you like . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"One day,"</em> you said to me, <em>"I saw the sunset
        forty-four times!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And a little later you added:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You know--one loves the sunset, when one is so sad . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Were you so sad, then?"</em> I asked, <em>"on the day
        of the forty-four sunsets?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">But the little prince made no reply.</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"

    </div>
    <div class="story">On the fifth day--again, as always, it was thanks to the
        sheep--the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly,
        without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long
        and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"A sheep--if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"A sheep,"</em> I answered, <em>"eats anything it finds in its reach."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Even flowers that have thorns?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, even flowers that have thorns."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then the thorns--what use are they?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to
        unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it
        was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious.
        And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The thorns--what use are they?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince never let go of a question, once he had
        asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first
        thing that came into my head:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little
        prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They
        are naďve. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their
        thorns are terrible weapons . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself:
        <em>"If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer."</em>
        Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And you actually believe that the flowers--"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh, no!"</em> I cried. <em>"No, no, no! I don't
        believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head.
        Don't you see--I am very busy with matters of consequence!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He stared at me, thunderstruck.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Matters of consequence!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers
        black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him
        extremely ugly . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You talk just like the grown-ups!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You mix everything up together . . . You confuse
        everything . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the
        breeze.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced
        gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has
        never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures.
        And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of
        consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man--he is
        a mushroom!"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"A what?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"A mushroom!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince was now white with rage.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of
        years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And
        is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so
        much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare
        between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence
        than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums? And if I know--I, myself--one flower
        which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which
        one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even
        noticing what he is doing--Oh! You think that is not important!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">His face turned from white to red as he continued:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single
        blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make
        him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my
        flower is there . . .' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his
        stars will be darkened . . . And you think that is not important!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He could not say anything more. His words were choked by
        sobbing.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands.
        Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one
        planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took
        him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw
        you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your
        flower. I will--"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and
        blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and
        go on hand in hand with him once more.
    </div>
    <div class="story">It is such a secret place, the land of tears.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="story">I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little
        prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring
        of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One
        morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded
        peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new
        flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this
        small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might,
        you see, have been a new kind of baobab.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to
        produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of
        a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge
        from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her
        beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the
        greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one.
        She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies.
        It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh,
        yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days
        and days.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed
        herself.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/8a.gif" height="265"
                                          width="211" alt="The Little prince and the flower"></div>
    <div class="story">And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she
        yawned and said:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me.
        My petals are still all disarranged . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh! How beautiful you are!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Am I not?"</em> the flower responded, sweetly.
        <em>"And I was born at the same moment as the sun . . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not
        any too modest--but how moving--and exciting--she was!
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I think it is time for breakfast,"</em> she added an
        instant later. <em>"If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--"</em></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/8b.gif" height="226"

    <div class="story">And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a
        sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.
    </div>
    <div class="story">So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her
        vanity--which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One
        day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the
        little prince:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Let the tigers come with their claws!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"There are no tigers on my planet,"</em> the little
        prince objected. <em>"And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am not a weed,"</em> the flower replied, sweetly.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Please excuse me . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am not at all afraid of tigers,"</em> she went on,
        <em>"but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant,"</em>
        remarked the little prince, and added to himself, <em>"This flower is a very

    <div class="story">But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in
        the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds.
        Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naďve
        untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in
        the wrong.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The screen?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me . . ."</em>

    <div class="story">Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should
        suffer from remorse just the same.
    </div>
    <div class="story">So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was
        inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously
        words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I ought not to have listened to her,"</em> he confided
        to me one day. <em>"One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply
            look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did
            not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which
            disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and
            pity."</em></div>

    <div class="story">And he continued his confidences:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The fact is that I did not know how to understand
        anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her
        fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her . . . I ought to have guessed all
        the affection that lay behind her poor little
        strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love
        her …"</em></div>

    <div class="story">I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the
        migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his
        planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He
        possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his
        breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he
        said, <em>"One never knows!"</em> So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too.
        If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any
        eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.

    </div>
    <div class="story">On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our
        volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of
        dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would
        never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed
        very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and
        prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he
        was very close to tears.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Goodbye,"</em> he said to the flower.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But she made no answer.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Goodbye,"</em> he said again.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I have been silly,"</em> she said to him, at last.
        <em>"I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood
        there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not
        understand this quiet sweetness.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Of course I love you,"</em> the flower said to him.

        <em>"It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no
            importance. But you--you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy . . .

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three

    <div class="story">He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325,

        add to his knowledge.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal
        purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both
        simple and majestic.

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"

    <div class="story"><em>"Ah! Here is a subject,"</em> exclaimed the king, when
        he saw the little prince coming.
    </div>
    <div class="story">And the little prince asked himself:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me
        before?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To
        them, all men are subjects.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Approach, so that I may see you better,"</em> said the
        king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit
        down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent
        ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of
        a king,"</em> the monarch said to him. <em>"I forbid you to do so."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I can't help it. I can't stop myself,"</em> replied the
        little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. <em>"I have come on a long journey, and
            I have had no sleep . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah, then,"</em> the king said. <em>"I order you to
        yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of
        curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That frightens me . . . I cannot, any more . . ."</em>
        murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Hum! Hum!"</em> replied the king. <em>"Then I--I order
        you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed.
    </div>
    <div class="story">For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his
        authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute
        monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"If I ordered a general,"</em> he would say, by way of
        example, <em>"if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if
            the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It
            would be my fault."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"May I sit down?"</em> came now a timid inquiry from the
        little prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I order you to do so,"</em> the king answered him, and
        majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But the little prince was wondering . . . The planet was tiny.
        Over what could this king really rule?
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Sire,"</em> he said to him, <em>"I beg that you will
        excuse my asking you a question--"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I order you to ask me a question,"</em> the king
        hastened to assure him.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Sire--over what do you rule?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Over everything,"</em> said the king, with magnificent simplicity.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Over everything?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other
        planets, and all the stars.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Over all that?"</em> asked the little prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Over all that,"</em> the king answered.

    </div>
    <div class="story">For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And the stars obey you?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Certainly they do,"</em> the king said. <em>"They obey
        instantly. I do not permit insubordination."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If
        he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch
        the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred,
        or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he
        felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he
        plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I should like to see a sunset . . . Do me that kindness
        . . . Order the sun to set . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to
        another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into
        a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received,
        which one of us would be in the wrong?"</em> the king demanded. <em>"The
        general, or myself?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You,"</em> said the little prince firmly.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which
        each one can perform,"</em> the king went on. <em>"Accepted authority rests
        first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves
        into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require
        obedience because my orders are reasonable."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then my sunset?"</em> the little prince reminded him:
        for he never forgot a question once he had asked it.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But,
        according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are
        favorable."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"When will that be?"</em> inquired the little prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Hum! Hum!"</em> replied the king; and before saying
        anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. <em>"Hum! Hum! That will be about--about--that
            will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I
            am obeyed!"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset.
        And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I have nothing more to do here,"</em> he said to the
        king. <em>"So I shall set out on my way again."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Do not go,"</em> said the king, who was very proud of
        having a subject. <em>"Do not go. I will make you a Minister!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Minister of what?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Minster of--of Justice!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But there is nobody here to judge!"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"We do not know that,"</em> the king said to him.
        <em>"I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is
            no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh, but I have looked already!"</em> said the little
        prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet.
        On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then you shall judge yourself,"</em> the king answered.
        <em>"that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to
            judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly,
            then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes,"</em> said the little prince, <em>"but I can
        judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Hum! Hum!"</em> said the king. <em>"I have good reason
        to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night.
        You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death.
        Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each
        occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I,"</em> replied the little prince, <em>"do not like
        to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"No,"</em> said the king.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But the little prince, having now completed his preparations
        for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,"</em> he
        said, <em>"he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able,
            for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me
            that conditions are favorable . . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a
        moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I make you my Ambassador,"</em> the king called out,
        hastily.
    </div>
    <div class="story">He had a magnificent air of authority.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Good morning,"</em> said the little prince. <em>"That

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes?"</em> said the little prince, who did not
        understand what the conceited man was talking about.

    <div class="story"><em>"Clap your hands, one against the other,"</em> the
        conceited man now directed him.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised
        his hat in a modest salute.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,"</em>
        the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one
        against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.
    </div>
    <div class="story">After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew
        tired of the game's monotony.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And what should one do to make the hat come down?"</em>
        he asked.

    <div class="story"><em>"Why are you drinking?"</em> demanded the little prince.

    <div class="story"><em>"So that I may forget,"</em> replied the tippler.

    <div class="story"><em>"Forget what?"</em> inquired the little prince, who
        already was sorry for him.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Forget that I am ashamed,"</em> the tippler confessed,
        hanging his head.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ashamed of what?"</em> insisted the little prince, who
        wanted to help him.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ashamed of drinking!"</em> The tipler brought his
        speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.
    </div>
    <div class="story">And the little prince went away, puzzled.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,"</em> he

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"How is it possible for one to own the stars?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"To whom do they belong?"</em> the businessman retorted,

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I don't know. To nobody."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then they belong to me, because I was the first person

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to

        is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever
        thought of owning them."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, that is true," said the little prince.
        "And what do you do with them?"</em>

    <div class="story"><em>"I administer them,"</em> replied the businessman.
        <em>"I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is
            naturally interested in matters of consequence."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince was still not satisfied.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"If I owned a silk scarf,"</em> he said, <em>"I could
        put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could
        pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"No. But I can put them in the bank."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Whatever does that mean?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That means that I write the number of my stars on a
        little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And that is all?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is enough,"</em> said the businessman.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is entertaining,"</em> thought the little prince.
        <em>"It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which
        were very different from those of the grown-ups.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I myself own a flower,"</em> he continued his
        conversation with the businessman, <em>"which I water every day. I own three
            volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is
            extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some
            use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say
        in answer. And the little prince went away.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,"</em>
        he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.

    <div class="story">The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all.
        There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little
        prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a
        lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not
        one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not
        so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For
        at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if
        he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he
        sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And
        since it is beautiful, it is truly useful."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the
        lamplighter.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Good morning. Why have you just put out your
        lamp?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Those are the orders,"</em> replied the lamplighter.
        <em>"Good morning."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What are the orders?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he lighted his lamp again.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But why have you just lighted it again?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Those are the orders,"</em> replied the lamplighter.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I do not understand,"</em> said the little prince.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"There is nothing to understand,"</em> said the
        lamplighter. <em>"Orders are orders. Good morning."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he put out his lamp.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated
        with red squares.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was
        reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it
        again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for
        sleep."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And the orders have been changed since that time?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The orders have not been changed,"</em> said the
        lamplighter. <em>"That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned
            more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then what?"</em> asked the little prince.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then--the planet now makes a complete turn every minute,
        and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to
        light my lamp and put it out!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here
        where you live!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is not funny at all!"</em> said the lamplighter.
        <em>"While we have been talking together a month has gone by."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"A month?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he lighted his lamp again.
    </div>
    <div class="story">As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this
        lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which
        he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and
        he wanted to help his friend.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You know,"</em> he said, <em>"I can tell you a way you
        can rest whenever you want to. . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I always want to rest,"</em> said the lamplighter.
    </div>
    <div class="story">For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the
        same time.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince went on with his explanation:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Your planet is so small that three strides will take
        you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk
        along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk--and the day will last
        as long as you like."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That doesn't do me much good,"</em> said the
        lamplighter. <em>"The one thing I love in life is to sleep."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then you're unlucky,"</em> said the little prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am unlucky,"</em> said the lamplighter. <em>"Good
        morning."</em></div>

    <div class="story">And he put out his lamp.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That man,"</em> said the little prince to himself, as
        he continued farther on his journey, <em>"that man would be scorned by all the
            others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman.
            Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous.
            Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That man is the only one of them all whom I could have
        made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for
        two people. . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was
        sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440
        sunsets!

        himself when he saw the little prince coming.

    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little.
        He had already traveled so much and so far!
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Where do you come from?"</em> the old gentleman said to
        him.

    <div class="story"><em>"What is that big book?"</em> said the little prince.
        "What are you doing?"
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am a geographer,"</em> said the old gentleman.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What is a geographer?"</em> asked the little prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all
        the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is very interesting,"</em> said the little prince.

        <em>"Here at last is a man who has a real profession!"</em> And he cast a look
        around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and
        stately planet that he had ever seen.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Your planet is very beautiful,"</em> he said. <em>"Has
        it any oceans?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I couldn't tell you,"</em> said the geographer.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah!"</em> The little prince was disappointed. <em>"Has
        it any mountains?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I couldn't tell you,"</em> said the geographer.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And towns, and rivers, and deserts?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I couldn't tell you that, either."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But you are a geographer!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Exactly,"</em> the geographer said. <em>"But I am not
        an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer
        who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans,
        and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He
        does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks
        them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the
        recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer
        orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Why is that?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster
        on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Why is that?"</em> asked the little prince.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer
        would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I know some one,"</em> said the little prince, <em>"who
        would make a bad explorer."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the
        explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"One goes to see it?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the
        explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of
        a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But you--you come from far away! You are an explorer!
        You shall describe your planet to me!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened
        his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits
        until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Well?"</em> said the geographer expectantly.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh, where I live,"</em> said the little prince, <em>"it
        is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two
        volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"One never knows,"</em> said the geographer.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I have also a flower."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"We do not record flowers,"</em> said the geographer.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on
        my planet!"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"We do not record them,"</em> said the geographer,
        <em>"because they are ephemeral."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What does that mean--'ephemeral'?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Geographies,"</em> said the geographer, <em>"are the
        books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They
        never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its
        position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write
        of eternal things."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,"</em> the
        little prince interrupted. <em>"What does that mean-- 'ephemeral'?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the
        same thing for us,"</em> said the geographer. <em>"The thing that matters to us
        is the mountain. It does not change."</em>

    <div class="story">So then the seventh planet was the Earth.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count,
        there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000
        geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men--that
        is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.
    </div>
    <div class="story">To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you
        that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the
        whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the
        street lamps.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid
        spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the
        ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New
        Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to
        sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps
        in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that
        would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of
        Africa and Europe; then those of South America; then those of South America;
        then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of
        their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.
    </div>
    <div class="story">Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the
        North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the
        South Pole--only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be
        busy twice a year.

    <div class="story">When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a
        little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you
        about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea
        of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon
        the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to
        stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public
        assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and
        twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.

    <div class="story">The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell
        them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy
        themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make
        their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do
        not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know,
        confidence in me.

    <div class="story">The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one

    <div class="story">"Good morning," said the little prince.

    <div class="story">"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or
        seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows
        where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes
        their life very difficult."
    </div>
    <div class="story">"Goodbye," said the little prince.

    </div>
    <div class="story">After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The
        only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his
        knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. "From a mountain as
        high as this one," he said to himself, "I shall be able to see the
        whole planet at one glance, and all the people . . ."
    </div>
    <div class="story">But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened
        like needles.
    </div>
    <div class="story">"Good morning," he said courteously.
    </div>
    <div class="story">"Good morning--Good morning--Good morning,"
        answered the echo.

    <div class="story">"Who are you?" said the little prince.

    <div class="story">"Who are you--Who are you--Who are you?" answered
        the echo.

    <div class="story">"Be my friends. I am all alone," he said.
    </div>
    <div class="story">"I am all alone--all alone--all alone," answered
        the echo.
    </div>
    <div class="story">"What a queer planet!" he thought. "It is
        altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And
        the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them . . . On
        my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak . . ."

    <div class="story">But it happened that after walking for a long time through
        sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all
        roads lead to the abodes of men.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Good morning,"</em> he said.
    </div>
    <div class="story">He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Good morning,"</em> said the roses.
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his
        flower.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Who are you?"</em> he demanded, thunderstruck.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"We are roses,"</em> the roses said.
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him
        that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five
        thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"She would be very much annoyed,"</em> he said to
        himself, <em>"if she should see that . . . She would cough most dreadfully, and
            she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be
            obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life--for if I did not do that,
            to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die. . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Then he went on with his reflections: <em>"I thought that I
        was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a
        common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees--and
        one of them perhaps extinct forever . . . That doesn't make me a very great
        prince . . ."</em>

    <div class="story">And he lay down in the grass and cried.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"My life is very monotonous,"</em> the fox said. <em>"I
        hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are
        just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it
        will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step
        that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back
        underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And
        then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of
        no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But
        you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when
        you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the
        thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"One only understands the things that one tames,"</em>
        said the fox. <em>"Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy
            things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can

            happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and
            jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time,
            I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you . . . One
            must observe the proper rites . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What is a rite?"</em> asked the little prince.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/myslivec.gif" height="271"
                                          width="300" alt="A hunter"></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Those also are actions too often neglected,"</em> said
        the fox. <em>"They are what make one day different from other days, one hour
            from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday
            they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can
            take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time,
            every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at
            all."</em></div>

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="story">So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his
        departure drew near--
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah,"</em> said the fox, <em>"I shall cry."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is your own fault,"</em> said the little prince.
        <em>"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, that is so,"</em> said the fox.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But now you are going to cry!"</em> said the little prince.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, that is so,"</em> said the fox.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then it has done you no good at all!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It has done me good,"</em> said the fox, <em>"because
        of the color of the wheat fields."</em> And then he added:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now
        that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and
        I will make you a present of a secret."</em></div>
    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="story">The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You are not at all like my rose,"</em> he said.

        <em>"As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one.
            You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred
            thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all
            the world."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And the roses were very much embarassed.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You are beautiful, but you are empty,"</em> he went on.
        <em>"One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think
            that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself
            alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it
            is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass
            globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is
            for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we
            saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when
            she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she
            is <i>my</i> rose.</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he went back to meet the fox.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Goodbye,"</em> he said.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Goodbye,"</em> said the fox. <em>"And now here is my
        secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;
        what is essential is invisible to the eye."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What is essential is invisible to the eye,"</em> the
        little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes
        your rose so important."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--"</em> said
        the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Men have forgotten this truth,"</em> said the fox.
        <em>"But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you
            have tamed. You are responsible for your rose . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am responsible for my rose,"</em> the little prince
        repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
    </div>

    <div class="story"><em>"Good morning"</em>, said the railway switchman.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What do you do here?"</em> the little prince asked.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's
        cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"They are in a great hurry,"</em> said the little
        prince. <em>"What are they looking for?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,"</em> said the switchman.

    <div class="story">And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the
        opposite direction.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Are they coming back already?"</em> demanded the little prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"These are not the same ones,"</em> said the switchman.

        the little prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"No one is ever satisfied where he is,"</em> said the

    <div class="story"><em>"Only the children know what they are looking for,"</em>

    <div class="story"><em>"Good morning,"</em> said the merchant.
    </div>
    <div class="story">This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to
        quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need
        of anything to drink.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Why are you selling those?"</em> asked the little
        prince.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Because they save a tremendous amount of time,"</em>
        said the merchant. <em>"Computations have been made by experts. With these

    <div class="story"><em>"As for me," said the little prince to himself,

        leisure toward a spring of fresh water."</em></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"

    </div>
    <div class="story">It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the
        desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the
        last drop of my water supply.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah,"</em> I said to the little prince, <em>"these
        memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing
        my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I
        could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"My friend the fox--"</em> the little prince said to me.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has
        anything to do with the fox!"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Why not?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Because I am about to die of thirst . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is
        about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"He has no way of guessing the danger,"</em> I said to
        myself. <em>"He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is
            all he needs . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a
        well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.
    </div>
    <div class="story">When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the
        darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little
        feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last
        words came reeling back into my memory:

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then you are thirsty, too?"</em> I demanded.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Water may also be good for the heart . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew
        very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.
    </div>
    <div class="story">He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after
        a little silence, he spoke again:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that
        cannot be seen."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I replied, <em>"Yes, that is so."</em> And, without saying
        anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before
        us in the moonlight.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The desert is beautiful,"</em> the little prince added.

    </div>
    <div class="story">And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits
        down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence
        something throbs, and gleams . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What makes the desert beautiful,"</em> said the little
        prince, <em>"is that somewhere it hides a well . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious
        radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and
        legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever
        known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an
        enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its
        heart . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes,"</em> I said to the little prince. <em>"The
        house, the stars, the desert--what gives them their beauty is something that is
        invisible!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am glad,"</em> he said, <em>"that you agree with my fox."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my
        arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed
        to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that
        there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his
        pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and
        I said to myself: <em>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most
            important is invisible . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a
        half-smile, I said to myself, again: <em>"What moves me so deeply, about this
            little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a
            rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he
            is asleep . . ."</em> And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need
        of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a
        little puff of wind . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story">And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" width="100" height="117" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/chapter25.gif" alt="XXV">
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Men,"</em> said the little prince, <em>"set out on
        their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for.
        Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he added:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is not worth the trouble . . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the
        Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was
        like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be
        dreaming . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is strange,"</em> I said to the little prince.
        <em>"Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working.
        And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since
        forgotten.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Do you hear?"</em> said the little prince. <em>"We
        have wakened the well, and it is singing . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Leave it to me,"</em> I said. <em>"It is too heavy for
        you."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set
        it there--happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was
        still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling
        water.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am thirsty for this water,"</em> said the little
        prince. <em>"Give me some of it to drink . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And I understood what he had been looking for.
    </div>
    <div class="story">I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed.
        It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a
        different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk
        under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for
        the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas
        tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to
        make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The men where you live,"</em> said the little prince,
        <em>"raise five thousand roses in the same garden--and they do not find in it
            what they are looking for."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"They do not find it,"</em> I replied.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one
        single rose, or in a little water."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, that is true,"</em> I said.
    </div>
    <div class="story">And the little prince added:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand
        is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What
        brought me, then, this sense of grief?
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You must keep your promise,"</em> said the little
        prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What promise?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You know--a muzzle for my sheep . . . I am responsible
        for this flower . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The
        little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Your baobabs--they look a little like cabbages."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I had been so proud of my baobabs!
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Your fox--his ears look a little like horns; and they
        are too long."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he laughed again.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You are not fair, little prince,"</em> I said. <em>"I
        don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa
        constrictors from the inside."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Oh, that will be all right,"</em> he said, <em>"children
        understand."</em></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/25a.gif"
                                          alt="The Little prince"></div>

    <div class="story">So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it
        to him my heart was torn.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You have plans that I do not know about,"</em> I said.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You know--my descent to the earth . . . Tomorrow will
        be its anniversary."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Then, after a silence, he went on:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I came down very near here."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he flushed.
    </div>
    <div class="story">And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer
        sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I
        first met you--a week ago--you were strolling along like that, all alone, a
        thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place
        where you landed?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince flushed again.
    </div>
    <div class="story">And I added, with some hesitancy:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">The little prince flushed once more. He never answered
        questions--but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah,"</em> I said to him, <em>"I am a little frightened--"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">But he interrupted me.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I
        will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the
        risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed . . .

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" width="100" height="117" rel="lightbox"

    </div>
    <div class="story">Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When
        I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my
        little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Then you don't remember. This is not the exact spot."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or
        hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"--Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the
        sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I was only twenty meters from the wall, and I still saw nothing.
    </div>
    <div class="story">After a silence the little prince spoke again:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You have good poison? You are sure that it will not
        make me suffer too long?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I
        did not understand.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Now go away,"</em> said the little prince. <em>"I want
        to get down from the wall."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall--and I
        leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those
        yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even
        as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step
        back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the
        sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared,
        with a light metallic sound, among the stones.
    </div>
    <div class="story">I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my
        arms; his face was white as snow.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What does this mean?"</em> I demanded. <em>"Why are
        you talking with snakes?"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had
        moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not
        dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms
        around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot
        with someone's rifle . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with
        your engine,"</em> he said. <em>"Now you can go back home--"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"How do you know about that?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I was just coming to tell him that my work had been
        successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.
    </div>
    <div class="story">He made no answer to my question, but he added:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I, too, am going back home today . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Then, sadly--
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is much farther . . . It is much more difficult . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I realized clearly that something extraordinary was
        happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and
        yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I
        could do nothing to restrain him . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story">His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I
        have the muzzle . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he gave me a sad smile.
    </div>
    <div class="story">I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little
        by little.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Dear little man,"</em> I said to him, <em>"you are afraid . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I shall be much more afraid this evening . . ."</em></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/26a.gif" alt="The wall">
    </div>
    <div class="story">Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something
        irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that
        laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Little man,"</em> I said, <em>"I want to hear you laugh again."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">But he said to me:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Tonight, it will be a year . . . My star, then, can be
        found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Little man,"</em> I said, <em>"tell me that it is only
        a bad dream--this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"The thing that is important is the thing that is not
        seen . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, I know . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a
        flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the
        stars are a-bloom with flowers . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, I know . . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is just as it is with the water. Because of the
        pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember--how
        good it was."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Yes, I know . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I
        live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found.
        It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so
        you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens . . . they will all be your
        friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He laughed again.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear
        that laughter!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was
        when we drank the water . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What are you trying to say?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"All men have the stars,"</em> he answered, <em>"but
        they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers,
        the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky.
        For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were
        wealth. But all these stars are silent. You--you alone--will have the stars as
        no one else has them--"</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"What are you trying to say?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I
        shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you
        look at the sky at night . . . You--only you--will have stars that can laugh!"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he laughed again.</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/26b.gif"
                                          alt="The Little prince"></div>
    <div class="story"><em>"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all
        sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my
        friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window,
        so, for that pleasure . . . And your friends will be properly astonished to see
        you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the
        stars always make me laugh!' And they will think you are crazy. It will be a
        very shabby trick that I shall have played on you . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he laughed again.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given
        you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Tonight--you know . . . Do not come."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I shall not leave you,"</em> I said.

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a
        little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not
        worth the trouble . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I shall not leave you."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">But he was worried.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I tell you--it is also because of the snake. He must
        not bite you. Snakes--they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just
        for fun . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"I shall not leave you."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">But a thought came to reassure him:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It is true that they have no more poison for a second
        bite."</em></div>
    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"

    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="story">That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away
        from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was
        walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Ah! You are there . . ."</em>

    </div>
    <div class="story">And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall
        look as if I were dead; and that will not be true . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I said nothing.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You understand . . . it is too far. I cannot carry this
        body with me. It is too heavy."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I said nothing.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is
        nothing sad about old shells . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I said nothing.
    </div>
    <div class="story">He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at
        the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will
        pour out fresh water for me to drink . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I said nothing.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred
        million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh
        water . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he too said nothing more, becuase he was crying . . .

    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"Here it is. Let me go on by myself."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"You know--my flower . . . I am responsible for her. And
        she is so weak! She is so naďve! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to
        protect herself against all the world . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.
    </div>
    <div class="story"><em>"There now--that is all . . ."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one
        step. I could not move.
    </div>
    <div class="story">There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle.
        He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as
        a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: none;" rel="lightbox"
                                          src="/drupal/sites/default/files/images/maly-princ/zlaty.gif" width="374"

    </div>
    <div class="story">And now six years have already gone by . . . I have never yet
        told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see
        me alive. I was sad, but I told them: <em>"I am tired."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="story">Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say--not
        entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find
        his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body . . . and at night I love to
        listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells . . .

    </div>
    <div class="story">But there is one extraordinary thing . . . when I drew the
        muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will
        never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is
        happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story">At one time I say to myself: <em>"Surely not! The little
        prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over
        his sheep very carefully . . ."</em> Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in
        the laughter of all the stars.
    </div>
    <div class="story">But at another time I say to myself: <em>"At some moment or
        other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot
        the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night .
        . ."</em> And then the little bells are changed to tears . . .
    </div>
    <div class="empty"></div>
    <div class="story">Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the
        little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere,
        we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has--yes or no?--eaten a rose . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story">Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the
        sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes . . .
    </div>
    <div class="story">And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of
        so much importance!
